# Examples

This directory contains example implementations and sample code that demonstrate how to use the features available in the private repository. These examples use mock data and simplified implementations while maintaining the same interface as the production code.

## Directory Structure

```
examples/
├── config/          # Sample configuration setups
├── data/           # Mock data files
└── implementations/ # Example implementations of features
```

## Usage

Each example includes:
- Sample code that mirrors the production implementation
- Mock data that represents the expected data structure
- Documentation on how to adapt the example for production use

## Available Examples

1. **Basic Setup**
   - Configuration examples
   - Environment setup
   - Basic implementation patterns

2. **Feature Implementations**
   - Authentication flow
   - API integration
   - Data handling

3. **Testing**
   - Unit test examples
   - Integration test patterns
   - Mock data usage

## Getting Started

1. Copy the relevant example from this directory
2. Follow the setup instructions in each example's README
3. Replace mock data with your actual data
4. Update configuration values as needed

## Notes

- These examples are for reference only and should not be used directly in production
- Sensitive information and actual implementation details are kept in the private repository
- For full implementation details, refer to the private repository documentation
